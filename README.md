The dataset "Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior" on Kaggle contains data on mobile device usage, with columns includes: User ID, Device Model, Operating System, App Usage Time (min/day), Screen On Time (min/day), Battery Drain (mAh/day), Number of Apps Installed, Data Usage (mb/day), Age, Gender. There are 700 observations in the dataset.
Five interesting things I might explore in this dataset:

1.	App usage patterns across demographics (e.g., age, gender). 
2.	Clusters of battery drain and data use based on different types of phones to discover potential devices that are most energy/data efficient.
3.	Behavioral clustering to identify user personas. It might be useful to cluster users based on similar behaviors such as average session duration, types of apps used, and frequency of usage. Such clustering could reveal distinct user personas where people use phone a lot vs. who only use them occasionally.
4.	The clusters of operating system (ios vs. Andriod) based on different demographics.
5.	Age and Number of Apps Installed: Itâ€™d be interesting to see if younger users tend to have more apps installed compared to older users.
